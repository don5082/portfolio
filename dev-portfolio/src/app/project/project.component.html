        <div class= "proj_img" id="MS-output"></div>
        <li class="list">
            Implemented a full merge sort algorithm in MIPS assembly, including both the recursive sort routine and a generic merge procedure for combining two sorted subarrays
        </li>
        <li class="list">
            Designed and managed stack frames and register saving/restoring manually, following MIPS calling conventions for nested procedure calls
        </li>
        
        <li class="list">
            Used pointer arithmetic and index calculations to traverse arrays, manage subarray boundaries, and copy data between the main array and a temporary scratch buffer.
        </li>
        
        <li class="list">
            Built a reusable merge routine that accepts a function pointer to a compare function, allowing the sort logic to be decoupled from comparison logic
        </li>
        <li class="list">
            Verified correctness using a comprehensive test harness that validates sorting on multiple patterns (left half, right half, middle segment, and full array).
