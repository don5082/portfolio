    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>I’m a detail-driven Computer Science student with a strong focus on full-stack development, software engineering, and practical problem-solving. I enjoy building real, production-ready applications—from Angular front-ends and Spring Boot back-ends to low-level systems projects in MIPS and Python machine learning pipelines. I bring technical depth, strong communication, and leadership experience, often serving as a team coordinator in Agile environments to keep projects organized, clear, and on schedule. I’m passionate about clean design, intelligent systems, and creating software that has real impact.</h3>
